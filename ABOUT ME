 Student •Gamerdevil• Hi I am PIG_GOD and u might know my discord server on discord  :D
 
 
 So let me tell about myself. 
 I'm a student and I Love playing games and doing things on the internet. This started by my Brother you may know him as neptune on my discord server. He introduced me CS:GO on 
 his PC I had know idea that what was he doing it was complicated for me, Later he came to my house and showed me his YT channel I thought the video gonna be average as he is not
 a professionol but then what I see, his video was mind blowing his editing skills was the best. Then I wished I could play CS:GO and edit my video like my brother.I could'nt buy 
 CS:GO bcoz of (INDIAN EDUCATION SYSTEM). Now I see twitch streamer play Krunker and Krunker was free and online to play I spent lots and lots of time playing Krunker and then I 
 thought that NOW IS THE TIME OF INTERNET. I was pretty sad that what people say about my video coz I did'nt have a good editor. Later My 1st video completed 100 views It was my 
 favourite day of my life and it pretty motivated that now I would upload more video and so I became A youtuber ( yes small youtuber) and I wish I get a PC soon so I could upload 
 more video game....
 
 
                                                           And also very big thanks to my brotha who made this life possible.
